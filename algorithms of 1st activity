Steps:
1. Define the Student class with the __init__ method to initialize student details (student_id, name, age, courses, grade).

2. Define the StudentRecords class with the __init__ method to initialize an empty dictionary records.

3. Implement the add_student method in StudentRecords to add a student to the records dictionary using student_id as the key.

4. Implement the remove_student method in StudentRecords to remove a student from the records dictionary based on student_id.

5. Implement the get_student method in StudentRecords to retrieve a student from the records dictionary using student_id.

6. Implement the update_student method in StudentRecords to update student details using keyword arguments (kwargs). Use the setattr function to update attributes dynamically.

7. Create an instance of StudentRecords named records.

8. Create instances of the Student class with sample data (student1 and student2).

9. Add the student instances to the records instance using the add_student method.

10. Retrieve and print student details using the get_student method and accessing the attributes.

11. Update student details using the update_student method and print the updated information.
